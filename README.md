# Nbody brute force

Just little C++11 code who allow to solve NBody problem with brute force.

## How to compile

In terminal just type :

```
make
```

## How to use

The use is really simple. So to display help just type :

```
./n_body_brute_force -h
```

Output must be :
```
Usage : n_body [options]
Options:
   -n     Number of bodies
   -f     Path to input file contains bodies data
   -o     If this argument exist, output result are save in file for plot
   -h     Print this help
```

With `-n` just specified int, the program generated random bodies. with `-f` programe take input file who contains some data, to see file example, check `input_file` in depot.

So have fun and don't hesitate has to contact me if you found bugs :)
